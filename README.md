This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The purpose of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

A full description of the data is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
